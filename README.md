A playful and adorable Valentine's Day web project to ask the most important question:  
**"Will you be my Valentine?"** 🥺👉👈


## 🌟 Features

- A sweet and interactive prompt asking **"Will you be my Valentine?"**
- If the user clicks **"Yes"**:
  - They're taken to a cute page featuring a **cat holding a heart** 💌
- If the user clicks **"No"**:
  - The **"No"** button transforms to say **"Are you sure?"**
  - It keeps shrinking smaller and smaller to dodge the user's click 😼
  - Meanwhile, the **"Yes"** button grows more and more inviting!

## 🎬 Demo

> 💡 This project is perfect to send as a link to someone special!

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **HTML** (`index.html`) sets up the interactive question and buttons.
- **CSS** (`style.css`) styles the page and handles visual transitions.
- **JavaScript** (`script.js`) controls button behavior and redirection logic.
